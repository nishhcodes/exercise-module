What is GitHub?

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that provides Git repository hosting and tools for version control, collaboration, and 
project management. It allows developers to store, manage, and share their code while working together efficiently.

How GitHub Facilitates Collaboration & Version Control

1. Centralized Repository – Teams can store and manage code in a shared remote repository.
2. Branching & Merging – Developers can work on separate branches and merge changes when ready.
3. Pull Requests (PRs) & Code Reviews – Allows team members to review code before merging.
4. Issue Tracking – Helps teams track bugs, features, and discussions.
5. Continuous Integration (CI/CD) – Automates testing and deployment workflows.
6. Access Control – Permissions and roles ensure secure collaboration.

Alternatives to GitHub

1. GitLab – Self-hosted or cloud-based, with built-in CI/CD.
2. Bitbucket – Ideal for teams using Jira and Atlassian tools.
3. SourceForge – Supports both Git and Subversion (SVN).
4. Azure DevOps – Microsoft’s platform for Git repository hosting and CI/CD.
5. Gitea – Lightweight, self-hosted Git service.
