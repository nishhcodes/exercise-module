What is .gitignore?

.gitignore is a special file in a Git repository that tells Git which files and directories to ignore (i.e., not track) 
when committing changes. It helps keep the repository clean by preventing unnecessary or sensitive files from being included 
in version control.

Why is .gitignore Important?

1. Prevents Unnecessary Files from Being Tracked: 
- Temporary files, logs, and dependency directories (e.g., node_modules/) donâ€™t need to be committed.

2. Enhances Security: 
- It helps prevent sensitive files like API keys, passwords, and database credentials from being accidentally pushed to remote 
repositories.

3. Reduces Repository Size: 
- Excluding large binary files, caches, and build artifacts keeps the repo lightweight and improves performance.

4. Avoids Merge Conflicts:
- Ignoring automatically generated files (e.g., compiled files) prevents conflicts between developers.
